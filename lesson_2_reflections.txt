What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    -   An empty git respository is initialized.
    -   This repository does not contain any commits and any existing files are considered
        untracked by default
    -   Git version control can be used for the files and sub-directories in the directory
        for which a git repository has been initialized

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    -   Staging area contains only those files from the working directory
        whose versions we want git to track
    -   Provides flexibility in terms of the files to be tracked

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    -   By adding only those files to the staging area which constitute a logical
        change, even if the working dircetory has additional changes
    -   Then commit the changes in the staging area
