When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When collaborating with multiple people on the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - We may be working on some feature and not want the all the commits from
      remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Forks - replicate a repository on GitHub. Don't have permission to push
              commits to original repository
    - Clones - replicate a repository locally or from GitHub to local-machine
               Pull and push commits between local and remote repository
    - Branches - these are labels to commits in a repository. Useful when
                 experimenting with new features or working on side projects

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
